Percolation System GUI
Overview

The "Percolation System GUI" project is designed to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and interacting with the Percolation System. The core functionality is implemented in the Java class Percolation, utilizing the edu.princeton.cs.algs4.WeightedQuickUnionUF class for union-find operations.
Features

    Interactive Grid Display: Visualize the percolation system through an interactive grid where each cell represents a site.

    Real-time Simulation: Simulate percolation processes by opening sites and observing the system's dynamic behavior.

    Visual Feedback: Identify full sites to understand the percolation status visually.

    Parameter Adjustment: Adjust system parameters, such as grid size (n), to explore different percolation configurations.

    Statistical Information: View real-time data, including the number of open sites, to track system evolution.
